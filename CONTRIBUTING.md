# Contributing guide
Want to contribute to **ELEMENTIUM**? Awesome!
There are many ways you can contribute, see below.

## Opening issues
Open an issue to report bugs or to propose new features.

## Proposing pull requests
If you would like to contribute to this project, Pull requests are very welcome. Note that if you are going to propose drastic changes, be sure to open an issue for discussion first, to make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it. You will need to use git flow. This way, any and all changes happen on the development branch and not on the master branch. As such, after you have git-flow-ified your elementium git repo, create a pull request for your branch, and we'll take it from there.
